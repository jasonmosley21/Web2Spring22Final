            Late Winter Liminal
        </h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes it feels as though our favorite seasons are the in-betweens:
            the last golden drops of summer before fall, the aching remnants of
            winter before spring's blooming. The cusp between is a strange & sacred
            place, and one worth embracing with stories and objects that shimmer.
