                At The Spiral Bookcase, we think stories are the truest form of magick
                in the world. Whether it's an old fairytale in a new skin, a recently
                translated foreign work or a strange, skittering poem, we aim to
                highlight the kinds of stories that make you feel like you can step out
                of your skin for a moment. You know the kind: the ones that stay with
                you long after the bonfire has gone out.
