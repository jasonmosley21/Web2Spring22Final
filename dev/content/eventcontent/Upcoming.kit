        The Grand Bookseller Swap
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Saturday, February 26 from 1-4 PM
    </h3>
    <body>
        The lovely booksellers of A Novel Idea & The Spiral Bookcase — 
        Christina and Victoria, respectively — have grown a bit stir-crazy in 
        their little shops during the winter, so they’re orchestrating a grand 
        swap! <br> On Saturday, February 2 from 1-4 PM, Christina will be slinging 
        books at The Spiral Bookcase, located in Manayunk. The shop will be 
        stocked with all of Christina’s favorites and recommendations — 
        including her latest release, Creole Conjure. <br> And then on Saturday, 
        February 26 from 1-4 PM, we’ll be playing it in reverse with Victoria 
        slinging books at A Novel Idea, located in East Passyunk. All of 
        Victoria’s most beloved reads will be on the shelves for 
        recommendations to fly. <br> We hope to see you at the Grand Bookseller 
        Swap! Click here to see details and share with your friends on Facebook.
