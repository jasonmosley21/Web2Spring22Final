                        The lovely booksellers of A Novel Idea & The Spiral Bookcase — Christina and Victoria,
                        respectively — have grown a bit stir-crazy in their little shops during the winter, so
                        they’re orchestrating a grand swap!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Saturday, February 2 from 1-4 PM, Christina will be slinging books at The Spiral
                        Bookcase, located in Manayunk. The shop will be stocked with all of Christina’s favorites
                        and recommendations — including her latest release, Creole Conjure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And then on Saturday, February 26 from 1-4 PM, we’ll be playing it in reverse with
                        Victoria slinging books at A Novel Idea, located in East Passyunk. All of Victoria’s most
                        beloved reads will be on the shelves for recommendations to fly.
                    </p>
