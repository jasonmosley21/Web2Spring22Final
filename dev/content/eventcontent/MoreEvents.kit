                        The Spiral Bookcase is honored to present a weekend of writing
                        workshops with author Bharat Krishnan. Focused on
                        novel-writing, these two workshops — available to be taken
                        together or separately — will guide you through imbuing your
                        work with emotional honesty and authentic diversity. Packed
                        with exercises, handouts and engaging conversations, this
                        weekend provides hands-on tools for any writer working to
                        ensure their manuscript is all that it can be.
